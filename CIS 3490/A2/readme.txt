1.
-> P11 computes and displays the number of inversions by brute force
method from the given text file and calculates the time taken for
the algorithm's computation.
-> The time taken by using this method for the program is approximately
30 seconds.
-> The efficiency or time complexity of the brute force algorithm is O(n*n)

-> P21 does the same but by using the divide and conquer method i.e., by
sorting the array using merge sort algorithm.
-> The time taken by using this method for the program is approximately
0.04 seconds.
-> The efficiency or time complexity for this is O(nlogn)

Therefore we can see that the divide and conquer algorithm method is way
more efficient than the brute force method for finding the inversions.


2.
-> P21 computes and solves the convex hull problem using the brute force
method from getting the input by reading from a text file.
-> The time taken by using this method is approximately 0.8 seconds
-> The efficiency or time complexity of the brute force algorithm is O(n*N)
where n is the number of points and N is the number of points on Convex Hull

-> P22 does the same but by using the divide and conquer method i.e.,
by using recursive methods to sort the elements in small quantities.
-> The time taken by using this method is very small.
-> The efficieny or time complexity is O(nlogn)
